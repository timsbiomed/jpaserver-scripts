# Preparing and loading comp-loinc

Mostly this is about 2 or 3 scripts to install prerequisites, build or convert the files, and then load them.


In this case there are 3 ways to do comp-loinc:

1. do it with a release of OAK: install_release.sh, build_release.sh, load_release.sh

1. do it with the development head of OAK: install_dev.sh, install_dev.sh, load_dev.sh

1. just use a cached conversion from HOT-Ecosystem/owl-on-fhir-content: build.sh, load.sh
